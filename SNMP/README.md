# SNMP Enumeration Automation Script

This script is dependent on onesixtyone. It will be installed if it does not already exist.
Once finished, three files will be created:
1. ip-list will be created with a list of all the hosts.
2. A community file will be created will a list of all the community strings.
3. snmp-results will be created with all the results.

Credits to [@trailofbits](https://github.com/trailofbits "Trail of Bits Github") for creating [this](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) awesome software.

Don't forget to run analyzer.sh when you are done!
